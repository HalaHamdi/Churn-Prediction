## ðŸ›« Data Preparation

[Kaggle's](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jpacse/datasets-for-churn-telecom) telcom churn dataset was used which has some of the below features.

<table border="0" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: center;">
      <th></th>
      <th>CustomerID</th>
      <th>Churn</th>
      <th>MonthlyRevenue</th>
      <th>MonthlyMinutes</th>
      <th>TotalRecurringCharge</th>
      <th>DirectorAssistedCalls</th>
      <th>OverageMinutes</th>
      <th>RoamingCalls</th>
      <th>PercChangeMinutes</th>
      <th>PercChangeRevenues</th>
      <th>ReferralsMadeBySubscriber</th>
      <th>IncomeGroup</th>
      <th>OwnsMotorcycle</th>
      <th>AdjustmentsToCreditRating</th>
      <th>HandsetPrice</th>
      <th>MadeCallToRetentionTeam</th>
      <th>CreditRating</th>
      <th>PrizmCode</th>
      <th>Occupation</th>

The data preparation module supports the following:
- Handling missing values either with dropping or imputation techniques
- Handling high cardinality categorical columns
- Encoding categorical features using either: Binary, OneHot, Ordinal or frequency techniques.
- Standardize or Normalize numerical features.
- Handling numerical outliers
Alternatives for the function were implemented as well in case any model required further special preprocessing.
